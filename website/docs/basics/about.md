CashScript is a high-level programming language for smart contracts on Bitcoin Cash. It offers a strong abstraction layer over Bitcoin Cash' native virtual machine, Bitcoin Script. Its syntax is based on Ethereum's smart contract language Solidity, but its functionality is very different since smart contracts on Bitcoin Cash differ greatly from smart contracts on Ethereum. For a detailed comparison of them, refer to the blog post [*Smart Contracts on Ethereum, Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash*](https://kalis.me/smart-contracts-eth-btc-bch/).

If you're interested to see what kind of things can be built with CashScript, you can look at the [Showcase](/docs/showcase) or [Examples](/docs/language/examples). If you just want to dive into CashScript, refer to the [Getting Started page](/docs/basics/getting-started) and other pages in the documentation.
