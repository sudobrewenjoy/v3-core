AnyHedge is the first DeFi project built on top of Bitcoin Cash in the form of a synthetic derivatives platform. AnyHedge allows any two parties to enter into a smart contract together and speculate on the future price of an asset. One of the parties wishes to protect themselves against price fluctuations and takes the *hedge* position, while the other party wishes to speculate and takes a leveraged *long* position.

## SLP Mint Contracts

The Simple Ledger Protocol (SLP) is a token standard for Bitcoin Cash. By default SLP allows minting of new tokens using a *minting baton*. When this minting baton is held by a regular Bitcoin Cash account, the minting of new tokens is centralised. So instead, the *SLP Mint Contracts* move the minting baton into a CashScript smart contract that manages algorithmic minting.
