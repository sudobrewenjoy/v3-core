## v0.4.0
#### cashc compiler
- :sparkles: Add `.reverse()` member function to `bytes` and `string` types.
- :sparkles: Add bitwise operators `&`, `^`, `|`.
- :sparkles: Allow casting `int` to variable size `bytes` based on `size` parameter.
- :boom: **BREAKING**: Casting from `int` to unbounded `bytes` type now does not perform `OP_NUM2BIN`. Instead it is a purely semantic cast to signal that an integer value should be treated as a bytes value.
- :horse_racing: Compiler optimisations.
  - Use `NUMEQUALVERIFY` for the final function in a contract.
  - Only drop the final `VERIFY` if the remaining stack size is less than 5.
  - Pre-calculate `OutputNullData` argument size.
- :bug: Fix a bug where return type of `sha1` was incorrectly marked as `bytes32`.
- :bug: `Data.decodeBool` only treated numerical zero as false, now any zero-representation is considered false (e.g. 0x0000, -0, ...).

#### CashScript SDK
- :sparkles: Add ability to provide hardcoded inputs to the transaction rather than use CashScript's coin selection.
- :boom: **BREAKING**: Refactor the transaction flow to a fluent API
  - Remove the `TxOptions` argument and other arguments to the Transaction `send()` function.
  - Instead these parameters are passed in through fluent functions `from()`, `to()`, `withOpReturn()`, `withAge()`, `withTime()`, `withHardcodedFee()`, `withFeePerByte()` and `withMinChange()`.
  - After specifying at least one output with either `to()` or `withOpReturn()`the transaction is ready. From here the transaction can be sent to the network with the `send()` function, the transaction hex can be returned with the `build()` function, or the meep debugging command can be returned with the `meep()` function.
- :boom: Remove `Contract.fromCashFile()` and `Contract.fromArtifact()` which were deprecated in favour or `Contract.compile()` and `Contract.import()` in v0.2.2.

#### Migration
This update contains several breaking changes. See the [migration notes](/docs/releases/migration-notes#v03-to-v04) for a full migration guide.

## v0.3.3
#### cashc compiler
- :bug: Fix bug where variables could not reliably be used inside `OutputNullData` instantiation.

## v0.3.2
#### cashc compiler
- :sparkles: Add `OutputNullData(bytes[] chunks)`, an output type to enforce `OP_RETURN` outputs.
- :shell: CLI improvements
  - The `--output|-o` flag is now optional, if it is omitted or manually set to `-`, the artifact will be written to stdout rather than a file.
  - Add `--asm|-A` flag that outputs only Script in ASM format instead of a full JSON artifact.
  - Add `--hex|-h` flag that outputs only Script in hex format instead of a full JSON artifact.
  - Add `--args|-a` flag that allows you to specify constructor arguments that are added to the generated bytecode.
    - :warning: The CLI **does not** perform type checking on these arguments, so it is recommended to use the CashScript SDK for type safety.
- :bug: Fix a compilation bug that allowed compilation of "unverified covenants" (#56).
- :bug: Fix a compilation bug that allowed compilation of `OutputP2PKH(...)` without `new` keyword (#57).

#### CashScript SDK
- :globe_with_meridians: Browser support! You can now use CashScript inside web projects. Filesystem-based functionality such as compilation from file are not supported due to the nature of web, so CashScript files have to be read in a different way (e.g. Fetch API) and then passed into the CashScript SDK.
- :purse: Add `minChange` to transaction options. If this `minChange` is not reached, the change will be added to the transaction fee instead.

## v0.3.1
#### cashc compiler
* :warning: Add warnings when a contract exceeds 201 opcodes or 520 bytes.
* :bug: Fix a bug where an incorrect number of items were dropped from the stack after execution of a branch.

#### CashScript SDK
* :sparkles: Improve error handling.
  * Further specified `FailedTransactionError` into `FailedRequireError`, `FailedSigCheckError`, `FailedTimeCheckError` and a general fallback `FailedTransactionError`.
  * Add `Reason` enum with all possible reasons for a Script failure - can be used to catch specific errors.
* :mag: Add `instance.opcount` and `instance.bytesize` fields to all contract instances.
* :bug: Fix a bug where the size of a preimage was not accounted for in fee calculation for covenants.

## v0.3.0
#### cashc compiler
* :sparkles: Covenants abstraction! All individual preimage fields can be accessed without manual decoding, passing, and verification.
  * Available fields: `tx.version`, `tx.hashPrevouts`, `tx.hashSequence`, `tx.outpoint`, `tx.bytecode`, `tx.value`, `tx.sequence`, `tx.hashOutputs`, `tx.locktime`, `tx.hashtype`.
  * When any of these fields is used inside a function, this function is marked `covenant: true`, and requires a preimage as parameter (automatically passed by CashScript SDK).
  * The correct fields are efficiently cut out of the preimage and made available.
  * The first occurrence of `require(checkSig(sig, pubkey));` is identified, and preimage verification is inserted using the same sig/pubkey. **Important**: if you have multiple `checkSig` statements, keep in mind that the first will be used for verification.
  * Automatically cuts off VarInt from `scriptCode`, so `tx.bytecode` contains the actual contract bytecode.
* :sparkles: Output instantiation! Automatically construct output formats for covenant transactions.
  * `new OutputP2PKH(bytes8 amount, bytes20 pkh)`
  * `new OutputP2SH(bytes8 amount, bytes20 scriptHash)`
* :bug: Fix bug with invalid output when the final statement in a contract is an if-statement.

#### CashScript SDK
* :sparkles: Add `fee` option to TransactionOptions. This allows you to specify a hardcoded fee for your transaction.
* :sparkles: Automatically pass in sighash preimage into covenant functions. **Important**: uses the hashtype of the first signature in the parameters for generation of this preimage.
* :dizzy: Better fee estimation for transactions with many inputs.

## v0.2.3
#### cashc compiler
* :bug: Fix a bug where unequal bytes types (e.g. `bytes3` & `bytes8`) could not be concatenated together, as they were considered different types.

## v0.2.2
#### CashScript SDK
* :bug: Remove minimaldata encoding in `OP_RETURN` outputs that caused incompatibility with SLP.
* :name_badge: Renamed `Contract.fromCashFile` to `Contract.compile`.
  * The new function allows to pass in a path to a `.cash` file, or a string of the contract source code.
  * `Contract.fromCashFile` still exists for backward compatibility, but is deprecated and will be removed in a later release.
* :name_badge: Renamed `Contract.fromArtifact` to `Contract.import`.
  * The new function allows to pass in a path to a `.json` artifact file, or a JSON object of the artifact.
  * `Contract.fromArtifact` still exists for backward compatibility, but is deprecated and will be removed in a later release.
* :hammer_and_wrench: `instance.export`'s `file` argument is now optional.
  * If it is provided, the artifact is written to the file, if not, it is returned as an object.

* :bug: Fix bug in bytecode optimisation

#### CashScript SDK
* :sparkles: Support `bytes` types with bounded size, e.g. `bytes1`, `bytes13`, `bytes32`.

## v0.2.0
#### cashc compiler
* :racehorse: Implement compiler optimisations
  * For the final use of a variable, it is retrieved with `OP_ROLL` rather than `OP_PICK`. This removes the need to clean the stack at the end of a contract.
  * Final `OP_VERIFY OP_TRUE` is removed as there is an implicit `OP_VERIFY` at the end of a Script.
  * `OP_VERIFY` is merged with preceding opcode where applicable.
  * Shallow `OP_PICK` and `OP_ROLL` are replaced by hardcoded opcodes (e.g. `OP_SWAP`, `OP_DUP`).
  * Several other bytecode optimisations.
* :sparkles: Add `pragma` keyword to specify intended compiler version.
  * Example: `pragma cashscript ^0.2.0;`
  * Contract fails to compile when compiler version does not satisfy constraints.
* :rotating_light: Add CashProof for all individual bytecode optimisations and for example contracts from 0.1.2 to 0.2.0.
* :bug: Add "default case" for function selection that fixes a vulnerability where people could spend funds by not calling any function.
* :arrow_up: Update dependencies.

#### CashScript SDK
* :arrow_up: Update `cashc` and other dependencies.
